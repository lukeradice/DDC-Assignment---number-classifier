## Feature Extraction (Max 300 Words)

I use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of my test/train data. I first must normalise this data 
so cosine distance can be used as an effecitve measurement in nearest neighbour later on (means cosine similarlity won't
be influenced by magntidue of image vectors but their angles between one another). I find the top 170 principal components 
of the non-normalised training data and project the normalised training/test data when it is input in image_to_reduced_feature
onto this. Choosing to project onto non-normalised training data produced significantly better results, due to the fact PCA
captures the directions of maximum variance, which is tied to the original scale of the data, so information would be lost if
we normalised the training data before finding its principal components

## Performance

My percentage correctness scores (accuracy, to 1 decimal place) for the test data are as follows.

Accuracy on Noisy test data: 93.9%

Accuracy on Masked test data: 80.3%
